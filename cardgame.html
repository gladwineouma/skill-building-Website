            <P>A game full of fun and learning, by the end of the game
                you will have learnt more about natural selection. Natural
                selection is simply the nature through which living 
                organisms adapt and change in response to an environmental
                condtion.

                    <P>This is how to play the game:
                        Firstly, place the game board in the center. Shuffle the animal cards and create a draw pile.
                        Each player draws 4 cards to form their initials at hand. Players keep cards hidden from their
                        opponents. Players take turns in a specific order, On ones turn they play a card that either has
                        the matching color or number of the previously played and if they do not have that card they must
                        drop one to the pile and wait for the next round. We have action cards in the game and their role
                        is to give the next player a challenge to do. The action cards are dynamic elements to the game.
                    </P>
                </div>
                <div class="info2">
                    <p>   There are also other cards that give different tasks like: Skip card, which gets the next player 
                        to be skipped, Reverse card, which changes the current direction of the game, Wild card, which 
                        allows players to choose any color they want and continue while reflecting adaptability, Drop 
                        two cards, which forces the player to drop any two cards and the Swap card, which allows the 
                        players to swap hands akin to species forming a symbolic relationship.
                        To win the game, you must ensure to have cards at all times. Therefore the winner it the player 
                        with the most remaining cards, this will symbolize successful adaptation and survival of that 
                        player in this particular environment hence natural selection.

                <p>Card matching: Players must match the color or number of the top card on the discard
                    pile.
                </p>
                <p>Action Card: Action cards can be played at any time, regardless of matching colors or
                    numbers.
                </p>
                <p>End of turn: After playing or drawing, the players turn ends and play passes to the 
                    next player.
                </p>
                <p>Elimination: Higher-numbered cards can eliminate lower-numbered cards in play, allowing
                    for strategic challenges against opponents.
                </p>
                <p>Environmental Adaptation: Players should adapt their strategies based on the cards 
                    played and changing game dynamics.
